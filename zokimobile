Uređaji su predstavljeni u veljači 2016. godine na Mobile World Congressu u Barceloni 22. siječnja 2016. godine. Samsung Galaxy S7 se dizajnom minimalno razlikuje od Samsung Galaxy-a S6. Vraćen je utor za microSD kartice, ali i otpornost na vodu s IP68 certifikatom. Samsung Galaxy S7 se od Samsung Galaxy-a S6 ponajviše razlikuje po novom procesoru, novoj kameri, jačoj bateriji, brzom bežičnom punjenju, vidljivo boljem čitaču otisaka prstiju i još mnogo drugih detalja.","genre":"telefoni"},{"name":"LG G5","img_url":"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/68/LG_G5.jpg/1200px-LG_G5.jpg","thumb1":"http://www-deadline-com.vimg.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/the-beatles-1__140613232022-575x359.jpg","thumb2":"https://le0pard13.files.wordpress.com/2013/11/the-beatles-remastered.jpg","thumb3":"http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/03318/beattles-1966_3318771b.jpg","info":"G5 je izgrađen sa jednodelnom šasijom;"mikro-dizajn" procez koristi plastični prvi sloj da sakrije šavove potrebne za antenu.[4] Zakrivljena pravougana izbočina sadrži komponente kamere,i dno sadrži USB-C konektore.

The design of the G6 was complimented for being more elegant and expansive than the G5, albeit less elegant than the similar but curved design of the Galaxy S8. LG was panned for its shift back to a non-removable battery, but the battery itself was praised for having a larger capacity than that of the G5. It was acknowledged that while the G6 does not include the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 system-on-chip (making the Galaxy S8 perform better on benchmarks than the G6), there was no discernible difference in performance in real-world usage between them. The cameras were also praised for producing "sharp and vibrant images", with quality on par with other recent flagship phones. In conclusion, CNET felt that the G6 could appeal to users that had lost their trust in Samsung following the recall of the Galaxy Note 7, arguing that "while it doesn't have anything novel or buzzworthy, it's LG's most marketable and widely-appealing phone yet.","genre":"telefoni"},{"name":"Huawei P10","img_url":"https://liaow.com/propic/huawei/p10plus/huawei-p10-plus-black.jpg","thumb1":"http://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/Metallica-1985-group-billboard-650.jpg","thumb2":"http://images1.mtv.com/uri/mgid:file:docroot:vh1.com:/sitewide/flipbooks/img/news/10_hottest_albums_september_08/05_81091189.jpg?enlarge=false&matte=true&matteColor=black&quality=0.85","thumb3":"https://www.morrisonhotelgallery.com/images/medium/rh-metallica-blackalbum001.jpg","info":"After the Huawei P10 went on sale, there were reports of netizens who found that the screen has a reduced layer of oleophobic coating.

Although reviewers noted the improvements to the camera, especially the dual rear camera on the Plus model, they also stated that the iPhone 7 did not make significant changes to the display or build quality, where competing flagship smartphones surpassed the quality of the iPhone 7. Many reviews highlighted the controversial removal of the 3.5 mm headphone jack; some critics argued that the change was meant to bolster licensing of the proprietary Lightning connector and the sales of Apple's own wireless headphone products, and questioned the effects of the change on audio quality. Apple was also mocked by critics for Phil Schiller's statement that such a drastic change required "courage".","genre":"telefoni"},{"name":"Iphone 6","img_url":"https://i.ebayimg.com/thumbs/images/m/m7yyVMW6MfSkHFrLNVBlEoA/s-l225.jpg","thumb1":"https://consequenceofsound.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-05-at-7-19-32-pm.png?w=807","thumb2":"http://www.guitarworld.com/sites/default/files/public/23669_guns_n_roses_2.jpg","thumb3":"http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/15/53/980x490/landscape-1451431425-guns-n-roses.jpg","info":"The iPhone 6 and 6 Plus received positive reviews, with critics regarding their improved design, specifications, camera, and battery life as being improvements over previous iPhone models.
